<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules:</h2>
<p>White and red pieces take turns making moves. A piece can move in any direction (
  compass directions). However, the amount of spaces it can move is determined
  by the total amount of pieces in a line of action. A line of action is considered the
  chosen direction including the reverse. So, if a column contains 3 pieces total, a piece
  in that column can only move three spaces if they choose to vertical movement. The same
  applies to horizontal and vertical lines.
</p>
<p>If there is an enemy piece at your intended destination, you are allowed to capture the
  enemy piece. When moving along a line of action, your piece is allowed to jump over friendly
  pieces, but can not jump over enemy pieces. The only time you may cross with an enemy piece is
  when an enemy is at your destination.</p>
<p>In order to win the game, all your pieces must be contiguous. This means that all your pieces
  are connected together adjacently in any direction. A game is tied if the move limit is reached.
  If a player moves a piece so that both sides are contiguous, then that player is the winner.
</p>
